	TIME Investments is an investment manager that puts the needs of our clients at the forefront of what we do. We pride ourselves on our superior client service, our commitment to innovation and delivery of stable performance. We offer products to clients of financial advisers, wealth managers, discretionary investment managers, family offices and charities. Our product range includes Inheritance Tax (IHT) solutions and Actively Managed Funds.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our Heritage</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	The four principals of TIME Investments have amassed a total of 64 years combined experience in the investment management, banking and professional services sectors. This experience has led to a solid reputation for delivering stable investment performance and proven tax-efficient solutions.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As part of the Alpha Real Capital LLP group, our investors and their professional advisers have access to the skills and expertise of a global co-investing investment manager with over &pound;1.5 billion of assets under management.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our Foundations</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	We are straightforward, commercial and fair and are active investment managers who target maximised results. We strive to achieve and protect long-term enhanced returns by being financially prudent and using risk exposure controls whilst adapting to changing market conditions. We always ensure that we take a responsible approach towards our investors, putting their interests at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our Goal</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Our goal is simple; to deliver strong investment performance for our stakeholders. We do this by developing intelligent investment strategies and actively managing our portfolios in pursuit of appropriate risk and reward. Our success is based on 4 principles.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	1. Putting clients first. By aligning our interests closely with those of our clients, we are driven to develop products and services which meet the needs of our clients. Client satisfaction is at the heart of everything we do.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	2. Highly disciplined approach to risk. We adopt a rigorous approach to due diligence to ensure that we really know what we&rsquo;re investing in. For each investment we utilise our own original research, not only to identify strategic opportunities for enhanced returns, but also to strengthen the evaluation and control of risk through a thorough analysis of the financial, commercial, legal and management issues. It is through this integrated approach that we are able to identify and extract superior risk-rated returns from real assets.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	3. Transparent &amp; Open. We believe that good corporate governance strengthens our business as it promotes transparency, reduces risk and helps builds greater relationships with our business partners.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	4. Hands-on investment style. We are collectively committed to a pragmatic and active investment style underpinned by core values of integrity, professionalism and approachability. Each of our talented fund managers operates an integrated and collaborative investment approach; this fosters a culture of deliverability and good decision making.</p>

	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	In addition to private individuals and family offices, the Alpha Real Capital group also invests on behalf of pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, government agencies and private foundations. Many of these institutions adhere to their own corporate responsibility policies and we are proud that they acknowledge that our interests are aligned and have invested in not only our funds, but our policies and our reputation also.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	As a minimum standard of conduct, TIME Investments endeavours to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and guidelines in all jurisdictions where we operate.</p>
